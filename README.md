```
# Package Contents

This library is currently includes
* data container class for a imaging mass spectrum
* tools for normalising imaging mass spectrometry data
* data container class for ion images
* tools for processing ion images
* some preliminary implementations of data converation utilities

### Processing a dataset ###
* Data should be in .imzml format
